# crypter

This snippet code provides aproach for encrypting the huge or large files (let say with size around 50-100 GB) .

The code shows how to handle big files in Python using memory mapping and asyncio. 
It reads file chunks asynchronously, processes them (original ide was encryption), and writes the results to file. 
Although encryption isn't implemented, the code illustrates another way to manage large files.
